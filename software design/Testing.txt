Retesting- In retesting we will testing we will check only check only those field which have defect. 
It is also called as confirmation testing or rechecking testing.

Regression- it is also called as re-executing or side effect testing.
tester will perform regression testing after retesting done.

The main aim of regression testing is to check the existing issue must be resolve without introducing new issue.

When to perform regression ?

1.After re-testing 
2. When any new module or feature added in the existing application.
3.When any existing module deleted from the application.
4.When environment change.
5. In organization partial regression are performed.

Black-box testing-

it is a test case design technique.
here we will pass input and check output.
it comes in system level.
back-box testing is also called as closed box testing or input-output testing or data driven testing.
In this testing, tester write the input or consider the input based on requirement.

 Techniques- 
ecp - equivalent class partitioning
bva- Boundry value analysis
dt- Decision Table

ecp - (equivalent class partitioning technique):-
we use this technique to write the test case to the editable fields.
it means combination of valid and In-valid ( Invalid Valid Invalid )

Age: 18 to 60 : class/range
steps-
1. Identify class
2. Divide the class into 2  part (valid and invalid)
3. Consider the any one value from each partition.
4.write down the test cases and consider the selected values.

Q1.Ecp ?
 -> it means combination of valid and In-valid ( Invalid Valid Invalid )

Q2.What is valid ecp value?
 ->( any value between 18 to 60 is valid)

Q3.What is Invalid ecp value? 
-->(any value less than 18 and more than 60)

Q4. What are the same equivalence class?

Age[18-60].

a) 21 27 52  ( correct ans)                    b) 12 14 24

c)61 66 17                                             d) 5 20 62

Q5.One of the field or the box which accept the rangle between 18 to 25 identify invalid equivalent value.

a)17 ( correct ) b)19 c)21 d)24

Q6)In examination the student need minimum 22 mark to pass and max 40 marks

a)22,23,26 

b)29,30,33 ( correct )

C)21,39,40

d)0,15,22

Q7)A page contain text box which accepts alpha numeric value identify value equivalence value.

BOOK

book

BooK

Boo01k ( correct)

Q8) A program contains have numeric field as follows
which of the following covers all the equivalent partition?

values less than 10 are rejected 

value between  10 and 21 are accepted

value greater than or equal to 22 are reject
    i    v   i 
a)10 11 21
b) 3 10 22 ( correct )
c)10 21 22
d)3 20 21 

2) Boundary value analysis:- 

In this technique we will test lower boundary and upper boundary.

Q1) valid boundaries ?
ans
5-12

Q2) Invalid boundaries ?
ans
upper boundary = +1
lower boundary=  -1

Q3) most boundary value?
ans

 4 ( incorrect )
 5
 12
 13 ( incorrect )

Q4) find out value ecp value and valid boundary?
range-4 to 12 and ecp , most boundary value , invalid ecp value, same equivalent class , value boundaries, valid ecp values, valid ecp valid and valid bva and invalid boundary.

1)ecp
invalid- less than 4
valid- 4 to 12
invalid - more than 12

2) most boundary
1,2,3 invalid
4 to 12 valid
more than 12 invalid

3) invalid ecp value
1 2 3 and more than 12

4)same equi

4 to 12

5)value boundaries

5 to 12

6) valid ecp values
5 to 12

7) valid ecp valid and valid bva 

5 to 12

8)invalid boundary

123 and more than 12

3) Decision Table-
we will use this technique when we have multiple decisions for writing inputs.

1-age >18
2- citizen = India 
3- marital status - yes / no

White box testing:-

in this we deals with code or internal mechanism of application.
it comes under unit testing level.
in white box testing we will check how input are process and check how output are generated.
it is also called as open box testing or glass box testing.

white box test design technique-
1. statement coverage
2. decision coverage
3. conditional coverage

1. statement coverage:-
statement means lines of code.
And coverage means how many attempt we will required to execute the code.

demo code-
read a
read b
if a>b
print a
end

draw follow char based on program follow:-


1.identify the logic of the code
2.draw flowchart based upon program flow.
3.compare program with diagram.
line no code = diagram attribute.

decision coverage-
we will focus on diamond.

if width is greater than length than biggest dimension is width.
if height is greater than width than biggest dimension is height.
end if biggest dimension is length then if height is greater than length biggest dimension is length

if(w>l)
	sop(w);
if(h>w)
	sop(h)


Conditional coverage:-
in this we will execute each and every diamond multiple time .
it is also called as path coverage.
